# CPU Notification

This project is used on my media server to constantly check the temperature
of the system and make sure it doesn't go over a target temperature that can be changed.

If it does reach higher than the target temperature it will send the owner an email that
the machine is overheating and advise them to take action


# Planned Features

Eventually I want to add the ability for it to read emails so that the user can 
send in commands for it to run to hopefully correct the problems. 

For example the user could reply asking for the server to be shutdown or restarted and the
script would read the email see the requested action and perform said action.
